To that end, we needed to incorporate a straightforward mechanism as follows:\r\n\r\nWe design these packed representations of nodes to contain only those attributes which the client needs to draw it.\r\n\r\n## Format\r\nThe string that represents the node is a sequence of parameters, each of which end with `?`\r\n\r\nA parameter is a triplet separated by two `!` s\r\n\r\nThe triplet is identified by TYPE,NAME, and VALUE\r\n### TYPE is an element of the set {B,N,S}\r\n`B` indicate the parameter is a boolean\r\n\r\n`N` indicates the parameter is a number\r\n\r\n`S` indicates the parameter is a string\r\n\r\n### NAME\r\nNAME is the name of the parameter\r\n\r\n### VALUE\r\nVALUE is the value of the parameter\r\n\r\n## Example\r\n`S!id!player1729?N!x!100?N!y!200?`\r\n\r\ntranslates to\r\n\r\n`{id=\"player1729\", x=100, y=200}`\r\n    \r\nSee also [Packed Node Parameters](packedParameters.html)"}
